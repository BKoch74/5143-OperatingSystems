## Difficulties/Challenges:
1) Implementing piping was our biggest challenge.  
2) When we joined all our commands we had some errors so that had some tweaking to do.
3) We ran into an indentation error.
4) Initially, we wanted to go with a command called sysCheck that would display the system health but ran into some problems with it. 

## Non-Working Components:
wc command produces a word count only, rather than lines, words, and bytes.
